            <li>How to create user <em>personas</em> and why</li>
            <li>What the pros and cons are on <em>personas</em></li>
            <li>That the most important thing is not the personas, but <em>understanding the needs and wants of your users</em></li>
            <li>How to write user stories</li>
            <li>That there are several different formats for user stories, and little agreement to <em>how</em> to do them, but near complete agreement that you need to do <em>something</em> to to determine your websites feature set and make sure it addresses the needs of your users</li>
            <li>What a wireframe is, why it looks the way it does, and what it is used for</li>

              Do I really have to go through all this trouble? Can't I just start coding
            </dt>
            <dd>
              Of course you can just jump into the coding. All shitty web developers do. Just admit that you suck, and you can skip all these formalities. Unfortunately, if "suck" is not the adjective you had in mind to describe your skill set, well, no, you can't really skip these steps.
